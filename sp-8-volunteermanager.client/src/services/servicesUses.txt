Description: The services folder encapsulates interactions with 
external services, such as APIs. This separation keeps your API 
calls organized and abstracted away from UI logic.

Example Use Case: In a social media application, you could have a 
userService.ts file that includes functions for making API requests 
related to users, such as fetching user profiles, updating user 
data, or fetching friends/posts of a user. This centralizes all 
user-related API logic, making it easier to maintain and update.
