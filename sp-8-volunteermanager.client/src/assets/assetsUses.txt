Description: The assets folder is where you store static files 
such as images, icons, fonts, 
and sometimes global stylesheets 
or CSS files that are not directly tied to specific components.

Example Use Case: In a blog application, 
the assets/images/ directory could contain default avatars for users 
who haven't uploaded a profile picture, the logo of the blog, and icons 
for social media links. The assets/fonts/ directory might include 
custom fonts used across the app.
