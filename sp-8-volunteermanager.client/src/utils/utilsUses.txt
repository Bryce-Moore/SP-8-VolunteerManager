Description: The utils or helpers folder contains utility 
functions that provide common, reusable logic across your application.
These functions typically do not interact directly with React 
components but offer formatting, calculations, or other 
general-purpose functionality.

Example Use Case: In an e-commerce platform, you might have a 
formatCurrency.js utility that formats numbers as currency strings 
according to different locales. This function could be used in 
product listings, cart summaries, and checkout pages to ensure 
consistent currency formatting throughout the app.
