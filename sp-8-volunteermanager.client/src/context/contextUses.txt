Description: The context folder is used for React Context API files. 
The Context API allows you to pass data through the component tree 
without having to pass props down manually at every level. This is 
particularly useful for global state management, such as user 
authentication status, theme settings, or application-wide 
configurations.

Example Use Case: For a shopping cart application, you might have a
CartContext.tsx file that creates and exports a context for the 
shopping cart. This context could be used to store the items in 
the cart, total price, and functions to add or remove items, 
making these accessible throughout the application without prop 
drilling.
