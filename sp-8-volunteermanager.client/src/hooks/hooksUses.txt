Description: The hooks folder contains custom React hooks. 
Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable 
functions. This can help in keeping your components clean and 
improving code reusability across your app.

Example Use Case: In a data dashboard application, you might 
create a custom hook useFetchData.ts that abstracts the fetching, 
loading state management, and error handling for API requests. 
This hook could be used across different components to fetch 
various types of data (e.g., sales data, user analytics) from 
your backend.
